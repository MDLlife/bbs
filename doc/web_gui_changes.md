# Changes for Web GUI

This may seem like a lot, but most of these changes are typo/wording changes.

### All Boards Page
1. The heading should be "All Boards", not "All Board".

2. "Not Found Board" should be "No Boards Found".

### Add/Change Page

1. "Select add" should be "Select Action".

2. Use "reference" instead of "key". \
    ie. "Board reference", "Thread reference", etc.
    
3. Get rid of "Input" key word for fields. \
    ie. "Input Board Name" becomes "Board Name".
    
4. For Action "Add Thread", the inputs should be:
    1. "Board Reference"
    2. "Thread Name"
    3. "Thread Description"
    
5. For Action "Add Post", "Input title" should be "Post Title".

6. Action "ChangeBoard" is really "Import Thread". Order of fields should be:
    1. "From Board Reference"
    2. "From Board Thread Reference"
    3. "To Board Reference"
